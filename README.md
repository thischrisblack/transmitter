# Transmitter

## A custom CMS built on React and Firebase.

A microblog / music player / code portfolio on the frontend, and a creativity archive manager on the backend. This is Transmitter.

![Transmitter public view.](./src/assets/img/screenshot.JPG)

Here's what it has:

1. **Blog.** Post whatever little bits of anything come to mind, from photos to sound files to anecdotes to links to jokes to coding projects and whatever else occurs to you.

- Make the posts public or private.
- On the admin side, filter by post type to review all entries of a certain type ("jokes" or "lyrics" or "images" or what have you).

2. **Music Player.** I am a musician, so I wanted a custom music player for my work.

- Batch upload your MP3s
- ID3 tag info extracted and stored in the database for diplay / filtering.

3. **Calendar.**

- Add pubilc of private events.

4. **Admin Features**

- Sort your posts by post type, and check out your calendar for your day's tasks.

5. **Mobile-first.** This app was made for your phone, to transmit your wisdom from anywhere at any time.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
